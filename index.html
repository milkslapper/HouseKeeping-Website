          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>My name is Alma, I have had my cleaning service for around 30 yrs. I am very professional, dependable, loyal and meticulous! I will be the only person in your home.....every time. I take pride in my work and make sure it is a job well done.
            <p>
              I specialize in:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>* Move Outs/Move Ins</li>
             <li> * Residential/Commercial</li>
            <li>  * Basic or Deep</li>
              <li>* One Time</li>
             <li> * Bi-Weekly</li>
             <li>* Monthly</li>
             <li> * Before/After Special Event</li>
             <li> * Vacancies/Selling</li>
             <li> * Carpet Cleaning</li>
            </ul>
              
              
             <p> I am here to make my customers happy and get/keep the job and not
              charge too much for the service either. I have seen here in the Tucson area,
              cleaning services that think they can clean because they clean "their
              home". We KNOW there are 2 different types of cleaning, and since I clean "professionally" it is a whole different ball game. I can't complain it is "job security" for me :-).
              
              Hopefully, we can do business together and we all will be happy. We will get a win/win price with you! Hope your enjoying your day!</p>
